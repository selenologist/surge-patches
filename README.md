#what's this?

My patches for Surge synthesizer https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/

Completely uncurated - I make them, they end up here. Most of them are bad. But perhaps they're more useful to someone else than they are to me.

Can be considered public domain as long as the Creator says Luna (some patches may be edits of someone else's patches)
